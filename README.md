## IQstack - Helping you put IQ back into your stack!

This project is being reorganized so many areas may or may not remain. Use of the project in production at this moment is not recommended because of the changes and new things being added like Chef recipes.

Also, if you're interested in OpenStack and want to use a good cluster then look at chef-bcpc from Bloomberg at https://github.com/bloomberg/chef-bcpc or a fork of that repo this is being worked at https://github.com/cloudm2/chef-bcpc. The forked version has a full Rally test package that will soon be merged into the master branch upstream at Bloomberg.

Tempest will be added soon.
